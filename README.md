   This will launch the application in development mode. You can view it in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To prepare the project for production, you need to create a production build. Follow these steps:

1. **Run the build command:**

3. **Deploy the contents of the `./build` folder to your hosting platform or server.**

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src**: Contains the source code for the application.
- **public**: Houses the public assets, including the HTML file used as the entry point.
